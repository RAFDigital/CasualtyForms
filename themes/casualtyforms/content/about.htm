<h2>About the project</h2>

<p>
    This important collection consists of records relating to the
    service of Royal Air Force Officers with the Expeditionary Force.
    The forms were used as both a method of noting incidences of
    illness, wounding and death and to record an Officerâ€™s movements
    between units, leave and promotions. Where relevant, information
    relating to awards for Gallantry, Courts Martial and Prisoner of
    War details were also recorded.
</p>

<p>
    Funded by the Esme Fairburn Foundation and the Heritage Lottery
    Fund, these forms have been conserved and digitised and are
    now ready to be transcribed by volunteers such as yourself.
    This will allow the collection to be made available and
    searchable online.
